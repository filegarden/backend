    Hi there,
</p>
<p>
    If you tried to sign up to File Garden with your email <a style="font-weight: bold;">{{ email }}</a>, the sign-up request couldn't be fulfilled because you already have a verified File Garden account.
</p>
<p>
    <ul style="padding-left: 1em;">
        <li>If this was you, try signing in instead of signing up. If you forgot your account's password, use the forgot password link in our sign-in form.</li>
        <li>If this wasn't you, you may safely ignore this message.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Thanks for using File Garden. :)
