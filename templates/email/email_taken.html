    Hi there,

    If you tried to sign up to File Garden with your email <a style="font-weight: bold;">{{ email }}</a>, the sign-up request couldn't be fulfilled because you already have a verified File Garden account.

    If you forgot your account's password, try clicking the forgot password link from our sign-in form.

    If this wasn't you, you may safely ignore this message.

    Thanks for using File Garden. :)
